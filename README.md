# python_100_program_practice_for_bioinformatics
Practice the python programming by bioinformatcis small tools. 

When I started studying bioinformatics, I learned Perl language to deal with NGS data.
Python has many support module can be used, such as, biopython, numpy, more than Perl.
Beside, Python is more popular than Perl now. So let's practice Python!  

## First Day
To count the string length
`count_string_length.py`

## Second Day
To make the DNA reverse complement sequence.
`reverse_complement.py`

## Third Day
To calculate the reads number of one fastq file 
`fastq_count_reads.py`
In this script, you will use the skill like:
- `sys.argv`
- open file, remember close the open file index.
- `str.endswith()` simply judgment the end of string 

## Fourth day
To calcutlate the read length status of one fastq file
`fastq_reads_length_status.py`
To calculate the number of each read length, and the average reads length in one fastq file.
